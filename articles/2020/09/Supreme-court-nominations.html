    SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS IN AN ELECTION YEAR
</h1>

<div class="post-date">24-SEP-2020</div>

<p>There is a bit of discussion about whether or not it seems legitimate or illigitimate for a president to fill a Supreme Court justice seat during an election year. I feel like we need to unpack that as well as briefly look at some history to put that very real question in context.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-proper-for-a-president-to-fill-a-supreme-court-seat-during-an-election-year">Is it proper for a president to fill a Supreme Court seat during an election year?</h2>

<p>Arguments for waiting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some people would prefer we wait for the will of the people to resolve with regard to the soon elected president, before the current president who may not be re-elected, makes such a nomination.</li>
  <li>Republicans were <em>for waiting</em> (2016), before they were <em>against waiting</em> (2020)</li>
</ul>

<p>Arguments against waiting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Democrats were <em>against waiting</em> (2016), before they were <em>for waiting</em> (2020)</li>
  <li>Ruth Bader Ginsburg said <em>“The president is elected for four years, not three years. So the power he has in year three continues into year four. Maybe members of the Senate will wake-up and appreciate that that’s how it should be.”</em> (2016)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="historical-facts-about-this-process-during-an-election-year">Historical facts about this process during an election year</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Filling a Supreme Court vacancy during an election year has occured <strong>29 times in US history</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Half of all US Presidents</strong> in US history have made nominations during election years with no problems</li>
  <li>For <strong>19 of 20 times, The US Senate and the President were affiliated with the same party</strong></li>
  <li>Of the 19 times when the US Senate and the US President were of the same party, <strong>17 nominations were confirmed in the election year</strong></li>
  <li><strong>10 times in US history</strong>, a US President of a party different from the majority party controlling the US Senate nominated a Supreme Court candidate <em>during an election year</em></li>
  <li>Of those 10 times <strong>where the President and the US Senate did not share a party affiliation, only 2 confirmations occured</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>

<p>There is historically no increased likelihood of a presidential nomination being either taken up or confirmed in an election year where the president and the party controlling the senate are not the same party. Said another way…</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Democrats and Republicans controlling the senate are <em><strong>not very likely to confirm</strong></em> a presidential candidate <em><strong>where their party affiliation is not a match</strong></em> during an election year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, Democrats and Republicans <em><strong>are much more likely to confirm</strong></em> presidential Supreme Court nominations during an election year <em><strong>when the party affiliation is the same and the candidate is qualified</strong></em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
