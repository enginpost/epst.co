    DARK SHEEP HUNTER
</h1>

<div class="post-date">19-OCT-2020</div>

<p>I am one of about two million or more people who have worked for the Federal Government. Being a part of that requires one of two outcomes for your mental health: You either become sickened by the process by what you can see as an insider, or you quickly learn to compartmentalize your life for sake of your sanity. I think Joe Biden knows this, and Hunter is a big aspect of his compartmentalization.</p>

<h2 id="verified-evidence-so-far">Verified Evidence So Far</h2>
<p>Recently, a number of pieces of evidences that Joe Biden has lived a politically compartmentalized life have come to light. A reasonable person will withhold degrees of judgement when evidence arrives that has not yet been fully verified. I am going to quickly explain what has been verified so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The laptop is not stolen. The contents are now owned by the repair shop due to the contract and the laptop not being retrieved by the owner in a timely manner. The information is not illegally being leaked. It is legally distributed by the owner.</li>
  <li>The FBI is in possession of a copy of the harddrive.</li>
  <li>After the news broke, the lawyer of Hunter Biden went to the repair shop owner and attempted to retrieve the laptop. At that point, the laptop was in the contractual ownership of the repair shop.</li>
  <li>The shop owner did not personally know Hunter Biden and could not say if Hunter or one of Hunter Biden’s associates actually dropped off the laptop initially. This inconsequential fact has been verified by the shop owner.</li>
  <li>The FBI nor any other intelligence agency in the Federal Government considers Hunters laptop an artifact of Russian disinformation. This was verified by the Director of National Intelligence in response to Rep. Adam Shiff’s spreading a lie that the laptop is a known asset of Russian disinformation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alleged-crimes">Alleged Crimes</h2>

<p>And here are a few of the alleged crimes depicted on the laptop:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Photos of Hunter Biden breaking international law by personally being involved in the abuse and sex slavery of minors.</li>
  <li>Photos of Hunter Biden doing drugs.</li>
  <li>Emails describing the creation of shell companies used to traffic funds to family members in exchange for political access to the then Vice president of the United States, Joe Biden.</li>
  <li>Communications describing the money laundering scheme showing explicit percentages of funds going to Joe Biden.</li>
</ul>

<p>Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe publicly stated that the above alleged crimes were being presented as questions by members of Congress and while he himself cannot speak about FBI investigations, the FBI is responsible to Congress to provide answers to them about the above crimes and the state of their investigation.</p>

<h2 id="compartmentalization-and-kick-back-schemes">Compartmentalization and Kick-back Schemes</h2>

<p>As someone who has worked in DC, I am certain I am not alone in having witnessed the kick-back scheme described in the above emails. They are both illegal and if violated in ignorance disqualify a person from ever working with the Federal Government again. I am specifically speaking about scenarios where one person (person A) assists another (person B) in getting that person (person B) paid for a service rendered, but where the first person (person A) gets a private payment and actually renders a service.</p>

<p>When I was in DC, I worked for a group that was a Federal contractor. We were writing up a bid to assist a smaller company win a contract to work with the Fed. Our role was an assisting and coaching role to the smaller company. In this type of contract, we would help them through the governmental red tape so they could grow as a business and provide a stronger partnership with the Fed going forward. We were allowed to take something like a maximum of something around 10% of the funding for the project to assist them. As a team member I watched my company and this small company work to provide a valuable contract bid. Just before the decision for contracting was rendered, over the course of one long weekend, I noticed the small business partner disappear from the group, replaced by one person who met everyone quickly and left the meeting. The individuals writing the bid proposal were very frustrated at the changes. In an afternoon break I asked about the frustration and was told the following story.</p>

<p>The owner was disappointed that we would only take in 10% max funds for the project. So at the last minute a friend who would qualify as a “small business” became the new small business partner on the contract write up. In exchange, we, the large coaching partner, would secretly do all of the work and take something like 90% of the profit. The new “small business” owner would simply be a figurehead who did nothing on the project other than help us win the Federal contract. This was a direct violation of the terms of this kind of contract.</p>

<h2 id="side-services-and-the-emoluments-clause">Side Services and the Emoluments Clause</h2>

<p>Needless to say I left the company. But more importantly, this is what is being described, fundamentally in the situations where the real value in the above schemes is Joe secretly rendering the service and getting a kick-back. This is likely a violation of the “domestic emoluments clause” as it is a specific compensation for the act of his political position. A violation of this clause would effectively disqualify Joe Biden if Congress prosecuted him. It would be immediate grounds for impeachment from any formal political position (impeachment is not something you only do to a president).</p>

<p>The other crimes alleged above position Joe Biden as a national security threat. This is a tough topic. If such scenarios existed and Joe Biden was simply looking to gain the appropriate security access required in order to work with the Fed, it is highly likely that he wouldn’t pass a background check. In an related but different track, elements of his background check would probably become the start of a fact-finding to determine if any crimes had been committed.</p>

<h2 id="why-hunters-behavior-matters-to-joe">Why Hunter’s behavior matters to Joe</h2>

<p>So why does it matter to the career of Joe Biden if Hunter Biden has a long track record of being a troubled individual specifically concurrently with his above alleged crimes? This is where compartmentalization comes in. If you work in DC you might get through an entire career deep enough into the working hierarchy that your compartmentalization is the act of ignoring the questionable behavior going on around you. But if you are higher up in those questionable conversations, you might actually be living two lives: one that participates in questionable behavior and conversations and negotiations while your other life looks like a Boy Scout. At least, that is how you live in your mind. If people figure out you are living two lives - they might not be willing to few you as compartmentalized, but rather compromised.</p>

<p>In the above case, you could mentally position Joe as a devoted father, willing to endure with a troubled son. You see him as a steadfast character giving him son multiple fresh new opportunities to begin again.</p>

<p>For those who have had a life inside the Beltway, you likely do not see it that way. If you worked in DC, you see Joe as using Hunter as a facilitating factor to his compartmentalization.</p>

<h2 id="hunter-is-joes-drug-of-choice">Hunter is Joe’s drug of choice</h2>

<p>Imagine if you had a kid would was a troubled drug addict and thief. You do ask your kid to pull it together and get help, but out of that other life you secretly live, you also ask the kid to split the profits each time he steals stuff. And eventually you help him get into situations where he can steal even more stuff.</p>

<p>These compartmentalization schemes are incredibly common in DC. But being common shouldn’t make it acceptable.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for Joe? The photos on the drive likely means that there are other even more incriminating realities that make Joe able to be blackmailed, internationally. We already know that Joe allows no oxygen between him and his sons. These factors will be weighed by national security to determine if he can be extorted in the future.</p>

<h2 id="why-withholding-a-degree-of-judgement-still-matters">Why withholding a degree of judgement still matters</h2>

<p>Many of the details in the drive can be verified. It is a matter of time. While it seems that nobody in the intel community is considering the drive to be Russian disinformation (that was fake news) we do not know if laptop itself and the content were owned and sourced by Hunter Biden. We should expect the FBI to let Congress know if that is true, or at least beyond a reasonable doubt. I hope we learn about this very soon. The American people need to know if the laptop was associate with Hunter Biden.</p>

<p>We just spent the last four years watching Congress attack the US president due to false information in the Steele Dossier. That started with an accusation and ended up having no real supporting artifacts or evidence. This situation starts with artifacts and evidence for potential crimes, and still needs to be tied back to Joe and Hunter. As an American, it bothers me that the FBI has had access to the laptop information for a year now. It either means it is a nothing-burger or the investigation has been flying below the radar for a long time.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-should-matter-right-now">Why it should matter right now</h2>

<p>I do not imagine the FBI will sort this out in the next couple weeks. As a result, if Joe Biden gets elected US President and a good portion of this is true, Joe might have to step down. This would leave Harris as president. If Dems knew this was coming, that would make Joe into a Trojan Horse for Harris as President. I get the vibe that people might be willing to vote for Joe and are less interested in seeing Harris become president due to her past political and legal behavior (for those who are paying attention to the details).</p>
